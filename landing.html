MetLife offers CII on both an Attained Age and an Issue Age basis. Attained Age rates are based on 5-year age bands and will increase when a Covered Person reaches a new age band. MetLife's Issue Age CII is guaranteed renewable, and may be subject to benefit reductions that begin at age 65. Premium rates for MetLife's Issue Age CII are based on age at the time of the initial coverage effective date and will not increase due to age; premium rates for increases in coverage, including the addition of dependents' coverage, if applicable, will be based on the covered person's age at the time of the initial coverage effective date. Rates are subject to change for MetLife's Issue Age CII on a class-wide basis. A more detailed description of the benefits, limitations, and exclusions applicable to both Attained Age and Issue Age CII can be found in the applicable Disclosure Statement or Outline of Coverage/Disclosure Document available at time of enrollment.
