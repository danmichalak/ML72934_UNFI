                <p>METLIFE <span class="variable-value">{{product_vars.ci_vars.name | uppercase}}</span> (CII) IS A LIMITED BENEFIT GROUP INSURANCE POLICY. Like most group accident and health insurance policies, MetLife's CII policies contain certain exclusions, limitations and terms for keeping them in force. Product features and availability may vary by state. In most plans, there is a pre-existing condition exclusion. After a covered condition occurs, there is a benefit suspension period during which most plans do not pay recurrence benefits, except in the case of insureds covered under a New York certificate. MetLife offers CII on both an Attained Age and an Issue Age basis. Attained Age rates are based on 5-year age bands and will increase when a Covered Person reaches a new age band. MetLife's Issue Age CII is guaranteed renewable, and may be subject to benefit reductions that begin at age 65. Premium rates for MetLife's Issue Age CII are based on age at the time of the initial coverage effective date and will not increase due to age; premium rates for increases in coverage, including the addition of dependents' coverage, if applicable, will be based on the covered person's age at the time of the initial coverage effective date. Rates are subject to change for MetLife's Issue Age CII on a class-wide basis. A more detailed description of the benefits, limitations, and exclusions applicable to both Attained Age and Issue Age CII can be found in the applicable Disclosure Statement or Outline of Coverage/Disclosure Document available at time of enrollment. For complete details of coverage and availability, please refer to the group policy form GPNP07-CI, GPNP09-CI or GPNP14-CI, or contact MetLife for more information. Benefits are underwritten by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, New York, New York.</p>
                <p>MetLife's <span class="variable-value">{{product_vars.ci_vars.name}}</span> is not intended to be a substitute for Medical Coverage providing benefits for medical treatment, including hospital, surgical and medical expenses. MetLife's <span class="variable-value">{{product_vars.ci_vars.name}}</span> does not provide reimbursement for such expenses.</p>
